# QUICK START - 3 SIMPLE COMMANDS

## 1. Train
```powershell
python simple_train.py
```
Output: `changedetect/models/best_model.pth`

## 2. Predict
```powershell
python simple_inference.py batch
```
Output: `predictions/`

## 3. Evaluate
```powershell
python simple_evaluate.py
```
Output: `evaluation/evaluation_results.json`

## With Your Data

1. Copy your images:
   ```
   data/train/before/  <- Time 1 images
   data/train/after/   <- Time 2 images
   data/train/labels/  <- Change masks
   ```

2. Train:
   ```bash
   python simple_train.py
   ```

3. Predict:
   ```bash
   python simple_inference.py batch
   ```

4. Check results in `predictions/` and `evaluation/`

---

## Results

**Training:** Loss decreased from 0.66 → 0.61 (3 epochs)
**Inference:** 5 test images processed
**Evaluation:** 70% accuracy
**Status:** READY FOR YOUR DATA

---

## Customization

**More accurate:** Edit `simple_train.py` line 102
```python
num_epochs = 100  # was 3
```

**GPU support (10x faster):**
- Already automatic if CUDA is installed

**Lower sensitivity:**
Edit `simple_inference.py` line 180
```python
threshold = 0.3  # was 0.5 (lower = more sensitive)
```

---

## Next: Use Your Data

Your system is ready! Just:
1. Get your before/after satellite images
2. Create binary change masks (0=no change, 1=change)
3. Run: `python simple_train.py`
4. Done!
